# HSA-Gripper

Developing an auxetic soft robotic gripper using handed shearing auxetics (HSA), and improving their performance by integrating a torsion-resistant structural layer.

To achieve my goals, I utilized 3D modeling and additive manufacturing to design and fabricate grippers, structures for mounts and assemblies.

Design and Engineering Analysis Software: SolidWorks, Anys Mechanical (FEA)  
Data Analysis: MATLAB, Python

Manufacturing/fabrication processes include stereolithography (SLA), fused deposition modeling (FDM), and material jetting.
