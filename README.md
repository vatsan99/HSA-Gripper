# HSA-Gripper

Developing an auxetic soft robotic gripper using handed shearing auxetics (HSA).

To achieve my goals, I utilized 3D modeling and additive manufacturing to design and fabricate gripper structures and assemblies.

Design and Engineering Analysis Software: SolidWorks, Anys Mechanical (FEA) \\
Data Analysis: MATLAB, Python

Manufacturing/fabrication processes include stereolithography (SLA), fused deposition modeling (FDM), material jetting (PolyJet$^{TM}$).
